Simple Base Library for C++ (libsimple-base) README
---

1.) About

This library is an accumulated collection of the common code I use when writing C++ applications.
The library incorporates some components by other authors. See "License" below for full details.


2.) Installation and Usage

See the file INSTALL for installation instructions.

To use the library in an application, use the preprocessor directive

#include <simple-base/base.h>

and add "-lsimple-base" to the compiler options to link with the static library.


3.) License

This library is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL).
See the file COPYING for details.

There are a couple of functions based on code snippets by various authors.
All of these are clearly marked as such by a comment in the source files.
Each comment includes the URL of the original code snippet.

The CRC32 code was generated by pycrc, from <http://www.tty1.net/pycrc/>.

The SHA-1 implementation is by Paul E. Jones, from <http://www.packetizer.com/security/sha1/>.

Globbing on non-POSIX systems utilises SimpleGlob, from <http://code.jellycan.com/simpleopt/>.
On systems where <glob.h> is present, the native glob functionality is used instead.
